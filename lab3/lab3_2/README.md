## Test Driven Development (TDD) approach

1. write the test first;
2. make sure the project can compile without errors;
3. defer the actual implementation of production code as much as possible.

This approach will be encouraged if we try to write the tests in a top-down approach: **start from the controller, then the service, then the repository**.
